# Flutter State Management Example



## Getting Started

Description:
This project demonstrates different state management techniques in Flutter, showcasing how to manage state in a Flutter application using various approaches such as Stateful Widgets, Flutter Hooks, Change Notifier with Stateful Widget,Change Notifier with Provider, Riverpod, and GetX.

The app just generates a random number between a minimum and maximum value that can change dynamically.

Stateful Widgets:
The Stateful Widgets approach is one of the basic state management techniques in Flutter. It involves creating a StatefulWidget class and managing state within the class. In this project, you can find an example of a counter app implemented using Stateful Widgets.

Flutter Hooks:
Flutter Hooks is a library that allows you to use hooks, similar to React Hooks, to manage state in a more functional way. The project includes an example of a counter app implemented using Flutter Hooks.

Change Notifier:
Change Notifier is a built-in Flutter mechanism for managing state changes. It involves creating a class that extends the ChangeNotifier class and using the Provider.of method to access the state. The project includes an example of a counter app implemented using Change Notifier.

Provider:
Provider is a popular third-party package for state management in Flutter. It provides a convenient way to manage state and share data between widgets. The project includes an example of a counter app implemented using the Provider package.

Riverpod:
Riverpod is a state management library that is built on top of Provider, offering a more modern and streamlined approach to managing state in Flutter. The project includes an example of a counter app implemented using Riverpod.

GetX:
GetX is another third-party package that provides state management capabilities along with other features like dependency injection and routing. The project includes an example of a counter app implemented using GetX.
